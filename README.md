# Customer-Behaviour-Analysis-Prediction

### Problem Statement
Customer Behavioir Analysis and Prediction is a thorough examination of a business' ideal clients. It makes it simpler for a company to adjust products in response to the particular demands, behaviours, and concerns of various sorts of customers and helps the company better understand its customers.

### Business Objective -
Consumer Behavioir Analysis and Prediction assists a corporation in tailoring its offering to its target market from various customer categories. For instance, a company can assess which customer segment is most likely to purchase the product and then market the product exclusively to that specific segment rather than investing money to market a new product to every consumer in the company's database.
